After installing git 
For windows right click on desktop and open gitbash
To check git version use command git  --version
git config – global user.name “username”
git config – global user.email “email”


working directory = project folder
repository – place where you save the project versions
ls --- files or command in that particular folder
git init – initialize new repository and also creates a folder called .git (folder is invisible). This .git folder have all the work you have done.
ls-a – shows all files and folders even the  hidden ones also.
To create file in the working folder use command 
	touch filename.extension – it works for windows also
To show the content in the file
	cat filename.extension
To save the file to the git 
Add files to staging area by using command 
	git add filename1 filename2 
if filename has space use escape sequence i.e backslash\
Another way i.e to add all files in working directory
	git add.
Want to remove files from working directory
	git rm –cached filename
To know the files in staging area 
	git status
want to save files in the staging area in to repository with a snapshot(40 char sha key and  with commit message)
	git commit
for commit there are two ways
	 using vim editor
	direct commit
It opens the vim editor 
	In vim editor type the commit msg
For Windows:
	Press esc and type :wq enter

For Linux:
	Ctrl + o
	Enter
	Ctrl + x
Another way is git commit -m “Commit Msg”

Another command to show the log of all the commits we made in reverse chronological order.
	git log
	recent commit shows first
git log --oneline first – commit log shorter by only displaying 7 characters of commit SHA key
